General notes

SARS-CoV-2 sequences were taken from the UniProt pre-release download (ftp://ftp.uniprot.org/pub/databases/uniprot/pre_release/, Feb 28th 2020).
For proteins contained in the replicase polyprotein 1ab (R1AB_WCPV), residue indexing begins from 1 at the start of each processed chain.
Regions at the N and C termini without confidently predicted structure have been omitted from the structure files.
Structure B-factors contain integer values in the range 1 - 3. 1 represents the highest model confidence and 3 represents the lowest.


Notes on individual predictions


M_protein
UniProt VME1_WCPV, includes residues 11 - 203.

Protein_3a
UniProt AP3A_WCPV, includes residues 38 - 233.
Substantial uncertainty in residue ranges 163 - 197, 208 - 233.

Nsp2
UniProt R1AB_WCPV, corresponds to residues 181 - 818.
Substantial uncertainty in residues 346 - 437 (prediction PDB indexing) so coordinates for these residues are not included in the structure file.

PL-PRO C terminal domain
UniProt R1AB_WCPV, corresponds to residues 2389 - 2745.
Included as this region appeared not to be covered by SWISS-MODEL.

Nsp4
UniProt R1AB_WCPV, corresponds to residues 2764 - 3252.
Uncertainty highest between domains.

Nsp6
UniProt R1AB_WCPV, corresponds to residues 3570 - 3847.
Uncertainty about positions of residues 84 - 132 and 238 - 278 relative to rest of structure (prediction PDB indexing).
